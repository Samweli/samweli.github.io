## Isochrone Map
I created a plugin to help map creators to use QGIS in producing isochrone maps, which are used to show accessibility of different facilities in service areas. This tool extends QGIS functionality in isochrone map creation. 

The plugin is open sourced, the plugin homepage is [here](https://github.com/Samweli/isochrones)

### Response
As of August of 2019 the plugin has over 7000 downloads in the QGIS plugin repository found [here](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/isochrones/)
