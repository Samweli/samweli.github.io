## Dar es salaam Transport
Dar es Salaam's public transport systems is mainly centred around Daladala buses. In addition there is a train, ferry, and BRT system.

As part of Ramani Huria team, In 2015 We worked together with [ally](https://www.door2door.io) (mobility based company) to map the entire public transport system in Dar es Salaam.

The main activities were to organise and assign the mappers bus routes to collect.
