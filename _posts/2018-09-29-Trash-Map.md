_Online Trash Map_

In August 2018 [HOT](https://www.hotosm.org) together with [Nipe Fagio](http://nipefagio.co.tz) organized waste data collection activity, allocating more than 
100 students/mappers to locate and collect information about the types of piles in the Dar es salaam City.

The aim of this activity was to raise awareness to the responsible institutions for waste management about the importance 
of data-driven decision and policy making and also to showcase how waste data can be used to measure and evaluate the 
waste collection problem in Dar es salaam.

The activity resulted into collection of more than 10,000 waste piles. After the activity the HOT team presented the 
data to  [TURP](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/tanzania-urban-resilience-program) program.

As part of TURP team, we analyzed the data and built a web map that visualized and provide important insights for the 
nearly 10,000 points. We used [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) together with a [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework, these enabled creating a 
vector based web map that has high rendering performance and a smooth user interaction.

The trash web map can be accessed [here](http://dar-trash-viz.netlify.app) and source code for the map [here](https://github.com/ResilientDar/dar-trash-viz/).

## Insights

The tool can be used as example on how we can use spatial data and technology to 
bridge the gap between the available waste data and the policy making. The current waste problem 
in Dar es salaam is a big hinderance to the city urban status and making sure that we have enough waste data and can easily access
them is one step to solve the issue.

In turn, having these kinds of data analysis tools provide means to do calculated measurements of the main problem and helps
in supporting data driven decisions. One of the interesting insights that the map highlights is the congestion of waste dumps
at/nearby the city center where there is more movement, population and local economic activities.

This insight can uncover the behaviour patterns that lies behind the trash issue, once these patterns are recognized and assessed.
The final solutions will backed with actual data and promise to resolve the main problems.

The web map infographics also shows that most of these trash points are accessible by vehicle or carts, meaning it is possible to reach
and have general cleanness activities that will ensure these points are always clean.



The web map serves as an example of how spatial data and geospatial technologies can be leveraged to bridge the 
gap between available waste-related data and effective policymaking. The current waste management challenges in Dar es Salaam
pose a significant obstacle to the city’s aspirations for urban development. Ensuring the availability and accessibility of 
reliable waste data is a crucial first step toward addressing this issue.

By enabling data analysis, such tools offer the ability to conduct informed and calculated assessments of main problems, 
thereby supporting evidence-based decision-making. One particular insight from the map is the 
high concentration of waste disposal sites in and around the city center—areas characterized by dense population,
increased human activity, and vibrant local economies.

Such insights can reveal underlying behavioral patterns related to waste disposal. Once identified and analyzed,
these patterns can inform solutions that are grounded in actual data, thereby increasing the likelihood of resolving
the main challenges.

Moreover, the web-based map infographics indicate that many of these waste accumulation points are accessible 
by vehicles or carts, suggesting that targeted cleaning and maintenance activities are feasible. 
This accessibility further supports the potential for sustained cleanliness and improved waste management 
in these areas.


## Future

There is for sure more metrics and analysis that need to be taken into consideration in order to proper address the
waste collection solutions in Dar es salaam using data, the city will have to realize the economical, enviromental and 
social metrics, this is what it will take to make sure we have a clean Dar es salaam.

The trash map hopes to serve as a motivation to other partners and stakeholders out there to back up and encourage
more waste data tech tools
that helps to showcase the gravity of the current waste problem.
