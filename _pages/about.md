I'm a multi-disciplinary software developer with a passion for solving complex problems and a strong ability to quickly adapt to new technologies. Currently based in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, I specialize in software development and web technologies.

## Personal Interests
When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music or engaging in board games, including a Tanzanian version of checkers.
